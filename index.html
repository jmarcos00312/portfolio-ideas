            <h2 class="intro1section">Intro</h2>
                <p>I started learning how to code around August of 2020. I am currently located in Temple, Texas, but willing to move for work. I am originally from the Philippines. When I was 12 years old I moved to Barbados and stayed there for two years. I came to The United states nine years ago. In 2019 I got a job as a dialysis technician and worked there for 18 months while I was studying for a nursing degree. However, I realized that nursing was not for me and decided to pursue a  career in software engineering. I am currently in the Thinkful Software Engineer Immerssion course.</p>
